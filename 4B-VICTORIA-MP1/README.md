## **Computer Vision**
A branch of computer science that empowers machines to see, recognize and process images just like humans.
A field of AI that enables computers to interpret and make decisions based on visual data, such as images and videos.
It uses artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) to process this data accurately for object identification and facial recognition, as well as classification, recommendation, monitoring, and detection.

## **How AI Systems Process Visual Information**
AI systems use computer vision algorithms to process visual information. The process involves capturing images through sensors or cameras, pre-processing these images to enhance their quality, and then using models and algorithms to analyze the visual data.

## **Role of Image Processing in AI systems**
AI image processing uses artificial intelligence to analyze and enhance images.
It involves tasks like pattern recognition, object detection, and image classification.
Core technologies include deep learning, neural networks, and machine learning algorithms.
Revolutionizes healthcare, security, and entertainment by automating complex tasks and improving accuracy.
