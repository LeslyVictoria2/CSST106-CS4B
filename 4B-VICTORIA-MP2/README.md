- In this activity, I explored key image processing techniques using OpenCV, a powerful library for computer vision. I installed OpenCV and successfully loaded and displayed an image, confirming that the library was working correctly. I then applied image transformations such as scaling and rotation, allowing me to resize and reorient images as needed for various tasks. These transformations are essential for adjusting image properties, which is useful in real-world applications like augmented reality and object detection.
- Additionally, I applied filtering techniques, including blurring and edge detection. Blurring was used to reduce noise in the image, while edge detection helped highlight object boundaries, which is crucial for identifying shapes and objects. Overall, this project provided hands-on experience with fundamental image processing techniques, enhancing my understanding of how these methods can be applied in AI and computer vision projects.
